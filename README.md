Analysis of Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program

## Overview of the analysis
#### The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Looking at a cleaned data set, I am analyzing the effects of the vine program on star ratings.

## Results
### Analysis
####
•	In the data set I looked at (Tool reviews) there is a total of 31,830 Vine and Non-vine reviewers.
•	Vine and Non-vine reviewer 5-star ratings total 14,777.
•	There are 163 Vine and 14,614 Non-vine 5-star ratings.
•	Due to the smaller amount of Vine reviewers, they only account for 0.51% of all 5-star reviews.
•	Non-vine reviews account for 45.9% of all 5-star reviews.

### Explanation
#### At first glance, it may seem that the program (at least regarding tool reviews) is a failure. Vine reviewers give less 5-star ratings than non-vine reviewers. However:
•	5-star reviews given by Vine reviewers, account for 57.2% of the total number of Vine reviewers.
•	5-star reviews given by Non-vine reviewers, account for 46.3% of the total number of Non-vine reviewers.

## Summary
#### There is positive bias for reviews in the Vine program because Vine program reviewers disproportionately give 5-star ratings (57.2% of vine reviewers are giving a 5-star rating as compared to 46.3% from Non-vine reviewers).
